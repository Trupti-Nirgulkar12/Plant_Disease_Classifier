# Plant_Disease_Classifier

Developed a Plant Disease Prediction System using image-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict plant diseases from leaf images. Preprocessed and augmented the image dataset, and trained a CNN model to identify disease patterns. The system predicts the type of disease affecting the plant based on visual symptoms, enabling timely intervention and improving crop protection.
